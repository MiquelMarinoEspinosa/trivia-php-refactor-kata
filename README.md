### Init development environment
The development environment require `docker` installed

Run the following commands:

```
make build
make up
make install
```
### Refactor strategy
- The first step should be have a good test coverage of the code before the refactor get started
    - Since the code is very tangled, using tools such as [approval tests](https://github.com/approvals/approvaltests.php) could help
- Once a good coverage has been achieved by tests, the refactor process can begin
    - The idea is to do small steps for each refactor, doing microcommits every time a success refactor has been done to set a safe point to return
    - Every time that a refactor is done, the tests are executed and the code coverage is scrutinized
- At this point, branches would be created to explore different solutions and the taken decisions would be detailed explained at this `README.md` file
